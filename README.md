# Setup Instructions

To see the app in action simply run the following

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is built using vite and written in React and Typescript so that should take care of everything.

## Completed Bonuses

1. Prevent cycles - completed using isValidConnection callback from React Flow
2. Search and Filter - search bar added to header and all nodes traversed from results to style
3. Functional cost and unlock logic - added logic and ui elements too make interacting with skill tree more stable and funcitonal

## AI Disclosure

Co-pilot was used to create a base for simple components (e.g. toast, modal, header), common algorithms (e.g. node tree traversal) and tests. These were all the customised to fit the specific requirements of the project. ChatGPT was also used for some general questions but very little was directly copied from there except for maybe some css.

\* The React Flow docs and examples were also used extensively and components were taken from shadcn and Lucide.
